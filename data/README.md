This folder contains the biological datasets, the simulated networks and results of the simulation experiments from the paper:
'Squirrel: Reconstructing semi-directed phylogenetic level-1 networks from four-leaved networks and sequence alignments' by Niels Holtgrefe, Katharina T. Huber, Leo van Iersel, Mark Jones, Samuel Martin, and Vincent Moulton.

## HIV
The HIV-1 sequence alignment is in the `hiv.fasta` [file], originally from the paper

## Primates
The sequence alignment for the Primate dataset was to large for GitHub, but can be found as [supplementary material] of the paper:
the primate file is too large and available at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rfj6q577d

## Xiphophorus
The `xiphophorus` folder contains a `.zip` file with `.txt` files, each specifying a tf-quarnet as produced by the MML-algorithm from:

## Simulations
The networks generated for the simulation experiments in the paper are in the file `dsfdsf`. The filenames have the format `oiij;oji`. The numerical results of the experiments are in the file `ddfgd`
